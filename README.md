# Learning Rust programming language

In this repository there are two toy projects used for learning RUST programming language.  
There will be another repository with an "advanced" project in which will be build an HTTP server.

These two project are simple but there are applied all the fundamentals of Rust programming as:

* basic data types;
* functions;
* macros;
* mutability;
* standard library;
* ownership;
* references and borrowing.

You will see that also in simple projects like this there is a lot to learn !  
Rust is very different from other languages so let's go RUST.  

These project are insprired by the Udemy course
